# Design Pattern

Design patterns are general reusable solutions to common software development problems that are encountered in the process of designing and building software applications. In Swift, as in other programming languages, there are several categories of design patterns, including Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Behavioral Patterns.

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. In Swift, there are several creational design patterns that can be used to create objects in a flexible and efficient manner. Some of the most common creational design patterns:

* Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

* Factory: The factory pattern is used when you want to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client. This pattern is useful when you have multiple implementations of an interface and you want to create objects based on a runtime decision.

* Abstract Factory: The abstract factory pattern is used when you want to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is useful when you have multiple related implementations of an interface and you want to create objects based on a runtime decision.

* Builder: The builder pattern is used when you want to create complex objects step by step. This pattern is useful when you have complex objects with a large number of parameters.

* Prototype: The prototype pattern is used when you want to create objects based on existing objects. This pattern is useful when you have an existing object that you want to modify and use as a starting point for creating new objects.

## Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns in software engineering are used to solve problems related to the composition of classes and objects. They help in identifying the relationship between objects and provide a way to compose objects to form larger structures. In Swift, there are several structural design patterns that you can use to improve the structure of your code. Some of the most common Structural design patterns:

* Adapter Pattern: The adapter pattern is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern is useful when you have two incompatible classes that need to work together.

* Decorator Pattern: The decorator pattern is used to add additional behavior to an object dynamically. This pattern is useful when you want to add functionality to an object without changing its interface.

* Facade Pattern: The facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes. This pattern is useful when you have a complex system and you want to hide its complexity from the client.

* Bridge Pattern: The Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.

* Composite Pattern: The composite pattern allows you to treat a group of objects as a single object. This pattern is useful when you want to create a hierarchy of objects and treat them uniformly.

* Proxy Pattern: The proxy pattern provides a placeholder for an object to control access to it. This pattern is useful when you want to control access to an object or when you want to delay the creation of an object until it is actually needed.

##  Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on communication and interaction between objects in a software system. These patterns define common solutions to recurring problems related to communication, delegation, and control of behavior between objects. In Swift, there are several behavioral design patterns that can be used to improve the structure and functionality of your code. Some of the most common Behavioral design patterns:

* Observer Pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. In Swift, you can implement the Observer pattern using delegates or closures.

* Strategy Pattern: This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. In Swift, you can implement the Strategy pattern using protocols and functions as the algorithms.

* Command Pattern: This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. In Swift, you can implement the Command pattern using closures or classes.

* Chain of Responsibility Pattern: This pattern creates a chain of objects that can handle requests in a sequential order. Each object in the chain can decide whether to handle the request or pass it on to the next object. In Swift, you can implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern using protocols and classes.

* Iterator Pattern: This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. In Swift, you can implement the Iterator pattern using a protocol and a custom iterator object.
